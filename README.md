# Imapct of Remote Work on Employee Well-Being
## Project Objective
This project explores how remote, onsite and hybrid work arrangements influence employee demographics, mental health, productivity and overall well-being. 
This analysis was performed using Power BI with insights gotten from multiple dimensions such as age, gender, work location and industry. 

## Tools Used
* Power BI (Data cleaning, analysis & visualization)
* Googles Sheets / CSV (Data source)
* GitHub (Documentation)

## Dashboard Overview

### ** Workforce Overview**
* Displays total employees, average age, and average years of age, average years of experience.
* Visualizes employees by industry, region, gender and job role.
* Helps understand the workforce composition and distribution across work modes.

### **Impact of Remote Work on Employees**
* Examines hows remote work impacts sleep quality, stress levels, and physical activity.  Measusres productivity changes and remote work satisfaction by work mode.
* Provides a holistic view of the effects of remote work on employee health and performance.

## Key Insights
1. Remote Job Satisfaction:
  * Project Managers reported the highest satisfaction  level (738 employees), while Marketing roles recorded the lowest satisfaction (683 employees).
  * This indicates that job type and autonomy may play a significant role in how employees perceive remote work.

2. Stress Levels by Gender
* Female employees (25.48%) experienced slightly higher stress compared to male employees (25.4%),
  suggesting that both genders face similar but notable stress challenges under remote conditions.

3. Stress Degree by Work Location:
* Remote workers recorded the highest overall stress level (~590), followed by hybrid employees (~561).
* On-site workers experienced relatively lower stress levels, staying below 400 in most categories.
* However, for low-stress levels, on-site employees (555) performed better than remote (547), confirming that remote work tends to elevate stress intensity.

4. Sleep Quality by Work Location:
* A majority of employees (582) reported having average sleep quality overall.
* In remote work settings, the number of employees reporting good sleep (566) was equal to those reporting poor sleep (566) indicating mixed sleep experienced among remote workers.

5. Change in Productivity by Work Location:
* The highest decrease in productivity was among hybrid workers (591), closely followed by remote workers (588), while on-site employees (558) reported slightly lowet declines.
* Increased productivity was more pronounced among remote workers (555) compared to hybrid and on-site (both at 514).
* This suggest tha tremote work environments produce the widest range of productivity outcomes, from the most improved to the most reduced.

  ## Recommendatons
  1. Monitor Stress levels proactiviely among workers and check the blood pressure of workers regularly to avoid body-breakdown.
  2. Reduce work-time among Remote workers to increase productivity and reduce stress.
  3. Encourage physical activities among workers to reduce stress.
  4. Promote balanced work routines, that is, encourage employees to establish structured daily routines and adequate rest time to combat poor sleep.
  5. Improve work infastructure such as clear communication channels, relaible digital tools, etc. These also aid to reduce stress in communication.
